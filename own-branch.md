# Working on your own branch

---
**Learning goals**

* Forking a repository
* Creating branches
* Creating files, and committing changes
* Comparing branches

---


## Step 1. Forking the repository

* This step should be done by everyone apart the repo owner
* Click on the `Fork` button on the top right of the page. This will create a copy of the repository on your own GitHub account (see that the name of the repository is now *your username/repo name*?)
* Step 1 completed. For this part of the tutorial, we will work on this copy of the repo and no longer on the original one (apart, again, the repo owner, who will work on the original repo)

## Step 2. Creating a branch

* Note a button `Branch: master`. So far we have used only one branch (`master`) but it is now time to get a branch on our own!
* Create a branch, using your name as the branch name
* Congratulation you create your own branch :tada:
* Note the button `Branch` again: now no longer report `master` but it has your new branch name: you create and checked it out at the same time!
* Step 2 completed. Time of doing some *serious* job here!

## Step 3. Creating and committing a new file

* Remember we created this branch to deal with an issue we self-assigned? Time to address it!
* Create a new file and use it to answer the question you have self-assigned. Write a few lines (so we can have some material to work on in the next steps) but remember that the goal is not to win the Costa Book Awards :stuck_out_tongue:
* Commit with a message/description as done before. Are you in the correct branch, the one with your name?
* Step 3 completed. Will your literary efforts be enough? 

## Step 4. Comparing branches

* After step 3, your branch will be one commit ahead of `master`. Can you see it?
* Let's now compare your branch with `master`. Any difference?
* Does everything look good? Everything there? 
* Step 4 completed. Time to move on and push these changes to the original repo.
