# Working on your own branch

---
**Learning goals**

* Creating branches
* Creating files, and committing changes
* Comparing branches

---


## Step 1. Creating a branch

* Note a button `Branch: master`. So far we have used only one branch (`master`) but it is now time to get a branch on our own!
* Create a branch, using your name as the branch name
* Congratulation you create your own branch :tada:
* Note the button `Branch` again: now no longer report `master` but it has your new branch name: you create and checked it out at the same time!

* Step 1 completed. Time of doing some *serious* job here!

## Step 2. Creating and committing a new file

* Remember we created this branch to deal with an issue we self-assigned? Time to address it!
* Create a new file and use it to answer the question you have self-assigned. Write a few lines (so we can have some material to work on in the next steps) but remember that the goal is not to win the Costa Book Awards :stuck_out_tongue:

* Commit with a message/description as done before. Are you in the correct branch, the one with your name?
* Step 2 completed. Will your literary efforts be enough? 

## Step 3. Comparing branches

* After step 2, your branch will be one commit ahead of `master`. Can you see it?
* Let's now compare your branch with `master`. Any difference?

* Does everything look good? Everything there? 
* Step 3 completed. Time to move on and push these changes to the original repo.
