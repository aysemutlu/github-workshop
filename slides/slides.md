# ~~Git/Hub for CollaborativeDataSci & DataEng~~
# Good Collaboration in Nearly Anything File-Based, using Github

###### By Alessia Visconti, Ester Ramos & Fei Phoon

---
# Good collaboration...

- allows a safe space for constructive and honest discussion.
- makes room and time for teaching and learning.
- accepts that there will be mistakes & mishaps - and that we'll help each other fix and learn from them.
- does not blame and shame.
- is first and foremost about working with and respecting other people.
- is NOT a "soft", optional skill for engineers - it's essential!

**Git & Github are only tools to help us focus on contribution and discussion.**

# Git & Github

- Git != Github

- Github: a web application that allows people to store and collaborate on a project. Today we'll learn to use this!

- Git: the underlying magic/the engine under the hood.


---
# Basic Git Concepts

- Repository
- Branch
- Master
- Commit
- Pull request
- Merge

# Workshop Time

Reminders for collaboration:

- Be kind (you can still be firm and opinionated though!)
- Leave constructive comments
- If you feel an online conversation is getting out of control, return to Meat Space :meat::space: and retry the discussion in person.
- If you're lost, ask for help! There are no stupid questions, only lost people who are feeling sad that they didn't ask for help sooner.

# To recap:

- Git concepts (mention sections)
- Workshop tasks


---
# Some comments (Github in the real world)

- Examples of non-code projects on Github
- Gists
- Notebooks & file diffs: Jupyter notebooks vs R Markdown
- Other interfaces for Git - workflow preferences: Bitbucket, Gitlab, Github Desktop, Git command line, code editors (Atom/Sublime/PyCharm)
- Open source and forking

# Your future lies in:

- finishing these exercises with your teammates (if you haven't already!)
- starring this repository for reference - we've added some light recap reading
- looking at the history of this repository - we collaborated remotely to make it!
- exploring Github & using it for a real project
- coming to our next session to learn to use Github Desktop and Git from command line
- learning to contribute to open source e.g. Pandas
