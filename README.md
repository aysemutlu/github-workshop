# GitHub for Better Collaboration in Data Science & Engineering

Hello! If you're at our workshop right now, please go [here](#Workshop).

If you missed out on our workshop, but want to see what we did, view our slides [here](/slides) and workshop [here](#Workshop).

If you *were* at our workshop and/or are looking for some light reading on Git & Github, go [here](DOCS.md).

## Workshop

### Setup

0. (Before the event) Sign up for your own Github account here: (https://github.com/join) & charge your laptop.
1. A welcome & brief introduction to basic Git concepts. (20min)
2. Everyone splits into groups of 2-4, one group per table. Say hello to your new teamates! (5min)

### Exercises

3. Each group should pick one teammate to create a repository in Github. It should have a README, LICENSE, description and `.gitignore`.
4. The repository owner should add their teammates as collaborators on the repository.
5. Everyone in each group should write their names in their group repository README and commit directly to `master`.
6. Everyone create an issue based on a question (from a provided list).
7. Pick an issue to resolve (assign it to yourself and leave a nice comment telling others you're gonna own it).
8. Everyone create a branch to address their assigned issue.
9. Create a folder and file (with path instructions)
10. Commit their new files to their respective branches.
11. Use compare on your own branch to look at your own changes, and open a pull request. Link to the issue in the pull request description.
12. Catch-up point/timecheck (how many groups have at least one pull request open).
13. Assign a teammate to review your pull request, e.g. the person who created the issue).
14. Look at the pull request you were assigned to review. View (file diff in the) pull request to see what was changed.
15. Change to the pull request's branch and learn to find/navigate files.
16. Make a general comment on the pull request you are reviewing.
17. Make a comment on any line in the file in the pull request (submit it with "Add a single comment").
18. Return to your pull request and read any comments left by others on yours. Click "Resolve conversation" on the comments (if everything is alright!)
19. Merge your own branch into `master`.
20. Delete your merged branch.
