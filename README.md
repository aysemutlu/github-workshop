### Exercises

3. Each group should pick one teammate to create a repository in Github. It should have a README, LICENSE, description and `.gitignore`.
4. The repository owner should add their teammates as collaborators on the repository.
5. Everyone in each group should write their names in their group repository README and commit directly to `master`.
6. Everyone create an issue based on a question (from a provided list).
7. Pick an issue to resolve (assign it to yourself and leave a nice comment telling others you're gonna own it).
8. Everyone create a branch to address their assigned issue.
9. Create a folder and file (with path instructions)
10. Commit their new files to their respective branches.
11. Do a compare (and open a pull request and link to issue in description).
12. Catch-up point/timecheck (how many groups have at least one pull request open).
13. Assign a teammate to review, e.g. the person who created the issue).
14. View file diff in the pull request to see what was changed.
15. The reviewer changes branches and learns "find/navigate".
16. Make a general comment on the pull request.
17. Make a comment on a line in the file on the pull request ("Add a single comment").
18. Click "Resolve conversation".
19. Merge branch into master.
