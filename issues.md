# Creating and dealing with issues

---
**Learning goals**

* Creating an issue
* Assigning an issue

---


# Step 1. Creating an issue

* Click on the `Issue` tab. This page lists all the issues, which are used to track todos, bugs, feature requests, and whatever you think fit. When you are opening an issue on a public repo, please look for a code of conduct, or for a bug reporting check list and comply with them  :relaxed:

* You are a team, therefore it is good to get to know one another a bit. Therefore, your *feature requests* will be asking (personal?) questions to  other team members
* Think of a question and use it as a title. Be creative, or use one of the questions below
* How the other team member should address the question? Describe it in the comment. Look at the examples below but please, no poem, the deal is to learn how to collaborate via GitHub, not to win the Pulitzer :stuck_out_tongue:

|  Question | Description  |
|:---|:---|
| What is your favourite food?  | Can you list the main ingredients? How often do you eat it? Can you cook it?  | 
| Where were you born? | Please, tell me how does it look!  | 
| What is your background? | I can see that you joined the AIClub, so you may be keen on AI, data science and the likes, but what did you study? |
| What do you do? | I can see that you joined the AIClub, so you may be keen on AI, data science and the likes, but what do you do to survive? |
| Why did you join this workshop?  |  Please, explain me how proficient (if any) you are with GitHub and what you are expecting from this workshop  | 

* Submit the new issue
* Step 1 completed. Your issue has been assigned a tracking number (gotten how the numbering works?)


# Step 2. Assigning an issue

* Once everyone has completed step 1, you should be able to see all the questions (hope that there are not too many duplicates!)
* Select a question you like and assign the issue  to yourself. To avoid having everyone dealing with the same question, **quickly** decide who is going to answer what **before** assigning the issue to yourself :sweat_smile:
* Great, you just committed to answer the question :nerd_face:
* Write a nice comment explaining that you are dealing with the issue right now. It is nice knowing that an issue has been assigned to someone, but it is even better knowing that someone is actually working on it!

* Step 2 completed!


# Step 3. Checking whether all issues have been assigned

* Once everyone has completed step 2, you should be able to see all the questions and who is dealing with them!
* Step 3 completed. This was easy, wasn't it?
