# Creating a repository (one person)

3. Pick a teammate in your group to create a repository in Github. Make sure it has:

  - an appropriate name
  - a description
  - public access
  - a .gitignore (pretend this will be a Python project and choose Python)
  - a README
  - a LICENSE

4. Now your teammate and new repository owner should add the rest of your groups as collaborators on the repository. Go to the repository settings and add them by Github username.
