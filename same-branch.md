# Working all on the same branch

---
**Learning goals**

* Editing files and committing changes
* Understanding basic issues underlining collaborations

---


## Step 1: Editing a file and committing changes

* The work carried on on our repo will be a collaborative one, therefore all the members of the team need to be acknowledged. On the main repo's page, you can see the content of the README file, which now just reports the repo's name and description. What better place to list all the contributors?
* Press the pencil on the left of the `README.md` box
* In a new line, immediately below the repo's description, add your name
* Include a commit message (you can use the suggested *Update README.md* or be more precise) and an optional extended description (what did you do?). Detailed commits are always highly appreciated, as the person that made them :wink:
* We will commit directly to the master branch (no action needed, but note the option of creating another branch)
* Commit changes
* Step 1 completed. Not too hard, right? 

## Step 2: Observing the results

* Wait for everyone to have completed step 1
* Refresh the main repo page
* Is your name still immediately below the repo's description? 
* What has happened? What can possibly go wrong in a real world scenario? Discuss with your team members :loudspeaker:
* Also, how many commits there are now?
* Step 2 completed. Let's move to a more organised (and less dangerous) way to collaborate
