# Setting up

---
**Learning goals**

* Initialise a GitHub repository
* Adding contributors, and accepting invitation to contribute

---



## Step 1: Initialising a repository 

* You will collaborate on a single repository, therefore you will need to create **one and only** one: choose one person in your team to do so (but watch out what they are doing)
* The *chosen one* should now go to their GitHub page (`https://github.com/loginname`) and click on the `Repository` tab. This page lists all your repository -- it may already include some :nerd_face:
* Create a new repo(sitory)

<kbd>
  
![create repo](https://github.com/feiphoon/github-workshop/blob/gh-pages/screenshots/create_repo.png "create repo")

</kbd>

* Your repository will need a name: agree on one! If you are having a creative block, names like *"github-collaborative-workshop"*, or *"AIClub-githib-workshop"* will be amazing, trust us :sweat_smile:
* Your repository will also need a description: why not *"A collaborative repo"*?
* Your repository can be *public* (everyone can access it) or *private* (only you and your collaborators will be able to access it). Since early 2019, GitHub allows an unlimited number of private repositories, but don't be shy -- and think of all the good you get from open access code. Time to give some love back?
* GitHub allows initialising a repository with a README file. Please, do so
* GitHub allows generating a `.gitignore` (which lists all the files that should not be included on a repo) and a `licence` file. Let's ignore the former but let's include the latter (quite a list, isn't it?)
* Choose an MIT license to keep it simple. Licenses are very important so next time you create a repo take your time to read the options and choose the one that fit your project best.

<kbd>
  
![choose license](https://github.com/feiphoon/github-workshop/blob/gh-pages/screenshots/license.png "choose license")

</kbd>

* Create the repository!
* Step 1 completed. Give each other a high five :raised_hands:

## Step 2: Adding contributors

* You landed on your repo main page. Only one person is allowed to _"collaborate"_ to it: the repo's owner. Time to change this :two_women_holding_hands: :couple: :two_men_holding_hands:
* The repo's owner should now click on the `Setting` tab
* Look then for adding `Collaborators` (you may be asked to type your password)
* Add the other members of the team, one by one, using their GitHub username or email

<kbd>
  
![add collaborators](https://github.com/feiphoon/github-workshop/blob/gh-pages/screenshots/collaborators.png "Add colaborators")

</kbd>

* Step 2 completed. Time for everyone to roll up their sleeves :muscle:


## Step 3: Accepting an invitation to contribute

* All the member of the team should receive an email inviting them to collaborate. Please accept: the more, the merrier!
* Step 3 completed. Ready for the real work? From now on, everyone has do to their homework, so no more looking at the *chosen one*!
