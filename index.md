# GitHub for Collaborative Data Science & Engineering in Industry & Academia

Welcome to our *collaborative* session on data science and engineering :wave:

This tutorial will walk you through:

* creating a GitHub repository
* adding contributors to a GitHub repository -- this is a *collaborative* session, after all :grin:
* creating files, editing and committing changes
* opening and assigning issues
* solving issues in a *collaborative* fashion via
	- branch managements
	- pull requests
	- code reviews

The tutorial will deal with the GitHub web interface, therefore there is no need to install anything on your machine, nor to type anything in the command line. We may address these in a more advanced session. 

## Prerequisites

1. Your own laptop, with battery charged, a working web browser (Chrome, Firefox, ...), and a good internet connection 
2. A GitHub account. If you don't have one you can sign up here for free: [https://github.com/join](https://github.com/join)
3. Friends. This is a *collaborative* session, don't forget that! 
	- Please create a team of three/four people 
	- Don't know anyone? There are no strangers here, only friends you haven't yet met.
	

## What are we going to do?

The tutorial is divided in five parts: 

1. Setting up
2. Working all on the same branch
3. Creating and dealing with issue
4. Working on your own branch
5. Merging all together


## Ready to start?

Before delving into the tutorial, please remember that **good** collaborations: 

* allow a safe space for constructive and honest discussion, therefore
* do not blame and shame
* make room and time for teaching and learning
* accept that there will be mistakes & mishaps (helping each other is a great way to learn)

Indeed, a **good** collaboration

* is first and foremost about working with and respecting other people
* is NOT a _"soft"_, optional, skill: it is essential!
